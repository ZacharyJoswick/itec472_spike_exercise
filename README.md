# ITEC 471 spike exercise

The task is to create an openapi documentation yaml file for the spike exercise from itec 470. How the api is implemented is completely up to you, but it should be logical and fulfill all requirements from that project. 

## Requirements

- The yaml file should conform to the OpenAPI 3.0 spec and should be readable in the online swagger editor. 
- The api you create should cover the endpoints necessary to complete the spike exercise from fall of 2019
- The yaml file should be committed to github in the folder corresponding with your name
- The yaml file should have no linting mistakes and should be formatted with an automatic linting tool

## Tips

- If you use vscode the swagger viewer plugin (`arjun.swagger-viewer`) you can edit the file while seeing a live preview
- There is an automatic linting extension for vscode (`mermade.openapi-lint`) which will prevent style issues
- Commit often and many times. You shouldn't have any merge conflicts as you are working on different files
