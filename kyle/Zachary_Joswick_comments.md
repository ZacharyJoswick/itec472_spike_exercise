Home get route: - [x]
* Typically a get call to an api takes a singular parameter such as ID
* A call without an id means get all, which we probably dont want to support
* There is no return information as it currently sits (I think you may have intended to make the body the response, but right now its the query body not the response body)
* The error code 405 is for method not allowed. This is an incorrect usage of the code
* You should handle the following error codes:
    - 404 - Requested id not found
    - 200 - Id found and successfully returned
    - 400 - Format of request was incorrect in some way
    - 405 - When someone attempts to make a post against this endpoint
* Responses should be in json format, not raw strings

User post route: - [x]
* User create route should handle the following codes:
    - 200 - successfully created user, Should probably return the id of the newly created user
    - 409 - Conflict as user already exists
    - 401 - You are not allowed to create users
* You should not supply an id in a user create method. The id should be generated by the backend systems and be returned to the user on success
* Response should be in json format

User login route: - [x]
* Logins should be posts not gets. A get has all information in plaintext which can expose passwords. Post request do not have this limitation
* Username and password should not be query parameters as this is visible to everyone
* Return value should be in json
* example value does not render correctly and is in xml format not json
* Information about rate limits and expiration is good, but beyond the scope of this applicaiton and should be implemented across the board if this is the intended operation

User logout route: - [x]
* Should be a post request
* Return value should be in json format
* In a stateless system, some indetification about the user needs to be attached to a logout request to know what user to logout. If this is done implicitly, then it should be noted in the description
* Should handle response case of user requesting log out while not logged in
* Should handle case of user logging out with invalid information

Get user route: - [x]
* Responses should be in json notxml
* You should never return passwords to the user, nor should you store them in plaintext. 
* The response should show two examples:
    - A user requests data about a different user. This should show a limited amount of information
    - A user requests details about themselves. This should return the full response
* Shoudl key off user id rather than username

Put user route: - [x]
* Should key off id
* Does not need to include id in body
* This entire route should probably be refactored to be a subroute to allow for updating individual pieces of information. Rather than replacing the object, you should have routes like `/user/{username}/firstName` which updates just the first name. That way, if there is more complex logic required to update the information (ie if username is used in multiple places)
* Responses should be in json format

Delete user route - [x]
* Should key off id
* Responses should be in json format
* 404 should be for a missing user
* 400 should be for an incorrect route (missing id or similar)
* Should handle the case of an unauthorized user trying to delete a user

Other general notes - [x]
* House model does not include all required information (beds / baths, price, location)
* User model should not include password
* ApiResponse is not used
